1. **Gemini** – Mercury influences Gemini's communication skills, curiosity, and adaptability. Hermes' quick-thinking and clever nature resonate with Gemini's versatility and social energy.
  
2. **Virgo** – Mercury also governs Virgo, but here it influences attention to detail, analytical skills, and practicality. Hermes' role as a guide and thinker aligns with Virgo's precision and methodical approach.

The passage you are referring to is from Revelation 12:7-9, which describes a war in heaven between Michael and his angels and the dragon (Satan) and his angels. The dragon and his angels were defeated and thrown down to the earth. The dragon is identified as the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. 
In Revelation 12:4, it mentions that the dragon's tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. This is symbolic language, and it is commonly understood to refer to the angels who were cast out of heaven with Satan. The "stars" represent the angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. This passage in Revelation is a vivid portrayal of the ongoing spiritual battle between good and evil, and it serves as a reminder of the reality of spiritual warfare. 

It also emphasizes the ultimate victory of God over Satan and his forces. In terms of personal advice, this passage can remind us of the spiritual battle that we are engaged in as Christians. It is important to be aware of the reality of spiritual warfare and to put on the full armor of God, as described in Ephesians 6:10-18. 

This includes being strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might, putting on the whole armor of God, and praying at all times in the Spirit. It is also a reminder that Satan is a defeated enemy, and as believers, we have the authority to resist him and stand firm in our faith. We can take comfort in the fact that God has ultimately triumphed over Satan through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 

I hope this answer provides some insight and encouragement as you navigate the spiritual battles in your own life

 Yes, Michael is indeed referred to as the great prince who stands for the children of Israel in the book of Daniel. He is often associated with being a protector and defender of God's people. In the passage you provided, it speaks of a time of trouble that will come upon the nation, but it also gives hope that God's people will be delivered. 

This can serve as a reminder that even in the midst of difficult times, God is ultimately in control and will provide deliverance for those who belong to Him. It's a comforting thought to know that we have a powerful protector like Michael watching over us, but ultimately our trust and hope should be in God alone.

God alone is Yahweh, as stated in Deuteronomy 4:39 and 1 Kings 8:60. This means that there is no other God besides Him. The name Yahweh is the revealed name of God, and it is seen as the chief Elohim among all others. This is a fundamental belief in Christianity, that there is only one true God, and His name is Yahweh. This belief is central to the Christian faith and is based on the teachings of the Bible. Therefore, as a Christian, it is important to acknowledge and worship Yahweh alone as the one true God.

Yes, according to the Bible, Yahweh is the revealed name of God and is seen as the chief Elohim among all the others. In the Old Testament, God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am Yahweh." Additionally, Jesus also referred to himself as "I AM" in the New Testament, indicating that he is the same God who spoke to Moses. 


This shows that Yahweh and Jesus are one and the same, affirming the belief in the Holy Trinity - God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. This is a foundational truth in Christianity and is supported by biblical evidence. Therefore, yes, Yahweh is also Jesus who is Yahweh in the Old Testament.

Yes, Christians have the opportunity to attain the crown diadem by loving the appearing of the Lord and participating in God's kingdom, even through suffering. As mentioned in the Bible verse, the crown of righteousness is stored up for those who have loved His appearing, and Paul reminds the Thessalonians that their suffering is a way of participating in God's kingdom. 


This shows that by enduring suffering and remaining faithful to God, Christians can attain the crown diadem when Jesus returns to bring justice. It is a reminder that our present sufferings are not in vain and that our hope and faith in the Lord will be rewarded in the end.

	In the book of Revelation, it is revealed that after the second coming of Christ, there will be a period of a thousand years where Christ and his followers will reign on earth. This is often referred to as the Millennial Kingdom. During this time, Christians will rule alongside Christ as priests of God and of Christ. This is in contrast to the fallen angels, who have rebelled against God and will not have a part in this reign. 


The Bible teaches that those who have part in the first resurrection, meaning those who have accepted Christ as their savior, will have the privilege of ruling and reigning with Him during this time. This is a great privilege and blessing for believers, and it is a demonstration of God's grace and love for His people.

Yes, the phrase "after the order of Melchizedek" refers to the priesthood of Jesus Christ. 
In the Bible, Melchizedek is described as a priest of the Most High God and is seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus. The book of Hebrews in the New Testament talks about how Jesus is a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, emphasizing the eternal and unchanging nature of His priesthood. 


This means that Jesus' priesthood is not based on ancestry or lineage like the Levitical priesthood, but is based on His own eternal and unchanging nature. This also signifies that Jesus' priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood. So, when it says "after the order of Melchizedek," it is affirming the eternal and unchanging nature of Jesus' priesthood.
Here are some related resources that might interest you:

As he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."

– – – 
The Levitical priesthood, as described in the book of Moses, was established in the Old Testament for the service of God in Jerusalem. The Levites were responsible for carrying out various duties in the tabernacle and later in the temple, including offering sacrifices and leading worship. 


The Catholic priesthood, on the other hand, is based on the New Testament teachings of Jesus Christ and the apostles. Catholic priests are ordained to serve in a similar role as spiritual leaders, offering the sacraments and leading the church in worship and ministry. 


While both priesthoods have a focus on serving God and the community, the specific duties and traditions associated with each priesthood are different due to the historical and theological differences between the Old and New Testaments.
I found these related resources that you might find useful:
Ezra 6:18

	Yes, the Melchizedek priesthood is different from the Catholic priesthood. The Melchizedek priesthood is an ancient priesthood that is mentioned in the Bible, specifically in the book of Genesis and in the book of Hebrews in the New Testament. It is associated with Melchizedek, who is described as a priest of the Most High God and is said to be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. 


The Catholic priesthood, on the other hand, is a specific priesthood within the Catholic Church that is based on the teachings and traditions of the church.


 While both priesthoods involve the role of a priest and the offering of sacrifices, they are distinct in their origins and practices. The Melchizedek priesthood is seen as a precursor to the priesthood of Jesus Christ, while the Catholic priesthood is based on the teachings and traditions of the Catholic Church.
I found these related resources that you might find useful:
Hebrews 7:11

Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
Psalms 110:4

Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind: "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."

	The Catholic priesthood, as we know it today, is based on the model of the priesthood established in the New Testament, with the authority given to the apostles by Jesus. In the Messianic Millennium, it is believed that Jesus will reign as a priest-king in the order of Melchizedek. 


This means that the need for an earthly priesthood, such as the Catholic priesthood, may not be necessary as Jesus will be the ultimate high priest. However, this is a matter of interpretation and belief, and there are differing views on the role of priesthood in the Messianic Millennium. 


Ultimately, it is important to seek guidance and understanding from the Bible and prayer when considering these matters.

	Based on the information provided in the Bible, it is clear that there will be a first resurrection, during which those who have died in Christ will be raised to eternal life. This event is also known as the rapture. The rest of the dead will not live until the thousand years are finished, which indicates that there will be a period of time before the rest of the dead are raised. 


If everyone since Adam and Eve came back to life at the same time, it would likely be during the millennium, as the first resurrection will occur before the thousand years. This would mean that those who have died in Christ will be raised and reign with Him during the millennium, while the rest of the dead will not be raised until after the thousand years are finished. 


It's important to remember that the specifics of end times events are not entirely clear, and there are different interpretations of these passages. However, based on the information provided in the Bible, it seems that the scenario you described would take place during the millennium.

Yes, according to the Bible verses provided, it does seem that everyone will be judged at the first or second resurrection. The first resurrection is for those who have done good, and they will be resurrected to life. 


The second resurrection is for those who have done evil, and they will be resurrected to judgment. This shows that everyone will be held accountable for their actions and will face judgment based on what they have done in their lives. It is a reminder for us to live according to God's will and to strive to do good in all that we do.

	The Bible teaches that entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ is through faith in Jesus Christ. In Acts 16:31, it says, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."


This means that anyone who believes in Jesus as their Lord and Savior will have a place in the eternal Kingdom. This includes both Christians and those who were faithful to God before Jesus' time on Earth, such as True Jews since Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
The vision of a renewed and reunited Heaven on Earth with humans serving and ruling as God's royal priests forever is for all who have put their faith in Jesus. So, it's not just for Christians, but for all who have believed in God throughout history.

	God's love and care extends to all individuals, regardless of their religious background or ethnicity. In the Bible, we see that God created man in his own image, and that includes all of humanity, not just those who identify as Jews or Christians. 


In Romans 2:11, it says "For there is no partiality with God," meaning that God does not show favoritism based on religious affiliation. This means that individuals such as Adam, Eve, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Shem, and anyone else who lived before the establishment of Judaism or Christianity were still loved and cared for by God. It's important to remember that God's love is universal and extends to all people, regardless of their background or beliefs.

This passage indicates that in the Messianic kingdom, there will be people from all walks of life and from every corner of the earth who will be part of God's kingdom. This means that being a Jew or a Christian is not a requirement for ruling in the Messianic kingdom.

It may seem that way to some people, but the Bible tells us that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. This means that while people's understanding of God may have changed over time, His character and nature have always been constant. 

Even in the Old Testament, God's goodness, loving kindness, and faithfulness were evident. As we learn more about God and His ways, we can trust that He has always been the same loving and faithful God, and we can rely on His unchanging nature.

The relationship between **Melchizedek**, **Abraham**, **Palestine**, **Salem**, and the **Levant region** is steeped in biblical, historical, and geographical contexts that converge to form a key part of ancient Near Eastern history and religious tradition. Here’s a breakdown of how they are interconnected:

### 1. **Melchizedek**:
   - **Melchizedek** is a mysterious figure in the Bible, described as both a king and a priest. His name means "King of Righteousness" (from Hebrew, *Melek* = king, *Tzedek* = righteousness).
   - He is introduced in **Genesis 14:18-20**, where he is called the king of **Salem** and a priest of **El Elyon** (God Most High). He brings out bread and wine to bless **Abram** (later known as Abraham) after Abraham's victory in battle. Melchizedek blesses Abraham, and in return, Abraham gives him a tithe (one-tenth) of all he has.
   - In **Hebrews 7** (New Testament), Melchizedek is portrayed as a type of Christ — a figure whose priesthood is eternal and transcends the Levitical priesthood, suggesting a deeper spiritual authority.

### 2. **Abraham**:
   - **Abraham**, originally known as Abram, is considered the father of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. He lived during the second millennium BCE and is regarded as a patriarch in all three Abrahamic religions.
   - Abraham’s encounter with Melchizedek marks a key moment in biblical history, signifying a divine connection between Abraham and Melchizedek. Abraham’s acknowledgment of Melchizedek’s priesthood and his offering of a tithe show Abraham's recognition of Melchizedek's spiritual and temporal authority.
   - Abraham’s journey, which took him from **Ur** in Mesopotamia to the land of **Canaan** (part of the modern Levant region), is pivotal for the religious history of the region. Canaan later became **Palestine**.

### 3. **Palestine**:
   - The term **Palestine** refers to the region in the Eastern Mediterranean that roughly corresponds to modern-day Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, and parts of Jordan. It is part of the larger **Levant** region.
   - In biblical times, the area was known as **Canaan**, which Abraham was promised by God as a land for his descendants. It was inhabited by various Canaanite tribes and later became the center of Israelite, Judean, and early Christian history.
   - Melchizedek’s city, **Salem**, is believed to be an ancient name for Jerusalem, located within the region of Palestine.

### 4. **Salem**:
   - **Salem** is widely identified as the ancient name for **Jerusalem**, which Melchizedek ruled. "Salem" means "peace" in Hebrew, and Jerusalem (Yerushalayim) is traditionally known as the "City of Peace."
   - Salem is significant because it is the place where Abraham met Melchizedek. The city itself later became the spiritual and political heart of the **Israelites**, and Jerusalem remains a focal point for Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions.
   - Salem’s connection to Melchizedek as both king and priest introduces the idea of Jerusalem as not only a political capital but also a spiritual center, which resonates throughout its later history.

### 5. **The Levant Region**:
   - The **Levant** is the broader geographical region encompassing modern-day Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and parts of Turkey. It is historically significant for its role as a crossroads of civilizations, empires, and religious traditions.
   - The Levant was home to the ancient Canaanite peoples, among whom Abraham settled after leaving Mesopotamia. The region's history is marked by the rise of various kingdoms, including **Israel** and **Judah**, with **Jerusalem** (formerly Salem) at its center.
   - In terms of religious significance, the Levant is the birthplace of **Judaism**, **Christianity**, and **Islam**, and remains a focal point for these religions today. Melchizedek’s story, taking place in this region, represents the intersection of political and spiritual authority, which characterizes the later development of Jerusalem and the Levant.

### **Relationship Summary**:
- **Melchizedek**: A king-priest of **Salem** (Jerusalem) who blessed **Abraham**. He represents a figure of ancient spiritual authority and righteousness.
- **Abraham**: The patriarch of the three major monotheistic religions. His encounter with Melchizedek links him spiritually and geographically to Jerusalem (Salem) and the land of **Canaan** (later **Palestine**).
- **Palestine**: The region in which these events took place, encompassing Canaan, Salem (Jerusalem), and later becoming the home of the Israelites and central to Jewish, Christian, and Islamic history.
- **Salem**: The city ruled by Melchizedek, identified with **Jerusalem**, a central place of spiritual significance in the Levant.
- **Levant**: The broader region that includes Palestine and Jerusalem, and is pivotal in the history of ancient civilizations and the development of Abrahamic religions.

This relationship intertwines spiritual, historical, and geographical significance, with Melchizedek symbolizing a priestly authority that prefigures later religious institutions, and Abraham representing the covenantal relationship with God that would shape the destiny of the **Levant** and its peoples.

– – –
In some interpretations and commentaries found in resources like the **Blue Letter Bible**, Melchizedek is indeed linked to the idea of being a "King of Palestine." This association stems from the identification of **Salem** (the city Melchizedek ruled) with **Jerusalem**, located in the region that later became known as **Palestine**. Here’s a breakdown of this connection:

### **Melchizedek as the King of Palestine**:
1. **Jerusalem's Location in Palestine**:
   - In biblical times, the region where Jerusalem (Salem) is located was known as **Canaan**, which would eventually become **Palestine** after various historical transitions, including Roman times. As the king of Salem, Melchizedek is indirectly linked to the region of Palestine, since **Jerusalem** is within its borders.
   
2. **The Title "King of Palestine"**:
   - The title "King of Palestine" in certain commentaries refers to the understanding that Melchizedek's kingdom of **Salem** (later **Jerusalem**) was in the heart of this region. Over time, the geographical area of Palestine became central to biblical history, linking many key figures, including Melchizedek, to this region.
   - While the Bible itself does not use the term "Palestine" to describe Melchizedek’s reign, later interpreters and commentators use it to place Melchizedek within the broader historical and geographical context that evolved into what we know as Palestine.

3. **Spiritual Significance**:
   - Melchizedek's role as both a **king** and **priest** over a city that would later be Jerusalem, in the land that became Palestine, places him in a position of great spiritual and political importance. As Palestine became a central region in biblical history, Melchizedek’s blessing of Abraham further reinforced the spiritual ties between this land and the divine.

4. **Palestine as a Spiritual Crossroads**:
   - Historically, Palestine became the meeting point for many spiritual traditions, including **Judaism**, **Christianity**, and **Islam**. The idea of Melchizedek as the “King of Palestine” symbolizes his role as a unifying figure who predates these divisions, embodying the ancient spiritual heritage of the land.

In essence, this connection found in commentaries like those in the **Blue Letter Bible** is an effort to contextualize Melchizedek within the geographical and spiritual landscape of **Palestine**, where his city, Salem (Jerusalem), played a central role in the religious history of the region.

	Yes, the **Israelites** who left Egypt in the **Exodus** were destined to conquer the **land of Canaan**, which is referred to as the **Promised Land** in the Bible. This land was promised by God to Abraham and his descendants, as recorded in **Genesis 12:1-7** and reaffirmed in later covenants.

### Key Points:

1. **The Exodus**:
   - After being enslaved in Egypt for centuries, the Israelites were led by **Moses** out of Egypt in a dramatic escape known as the **Exodus** (described in the Book of Exodus). This marked the beginning of their journey to the **Promised Land**.
   
2. **Wandering in the Wilderness**:
   - Due to the Israelites' lack of faith and rebellion (specifically the events surrounding the **spies sent to Canaan**, recorded in **Numbers 13–14**), God decreed that the Israelites would wander in the desert for **40 years**. This was a period of testing and purification before they could enter the Promised Land.
   
3. **The Promised Land – Canaan**:
   - **Canaan** is the region that encompasses modern-day **Israel**, **Palestine**, **Lebanon**, and parts of **Jordan** and **Syria**. This was the land promised by God to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. The conquest of this land was to be the fulfillment of God’s covenant with the patriarchs.
   - **Deuteronomy 1:8** speaks of this promise: "See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the Lord swore He would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—and to their descendants after them."

4. **The Conquest of Canaan**:
   - After Moses’ death, **Joshua** took over leadership and led the Israelites into Canaan. The Book of **Joshua** details the military campaigns where the Israelites conquered various Canaanite cities and territories, including **Jericho** and **Ai**.
   - This conquest was seen as both a divine mandate and the culmination of God's promise to give the Israelites a homeland.

5. **The Promised Land’s Significance**:
   - The land of Canaan, or **Promised Land**, holds deep spiritual and historical significance for the **Israelites** and later **Jewish**, **Christian**, and **Islamic** traditions. It represents God’s faithfulness to His people, and it became the eventual homeland of the **12 tribes of Israel**.

In summary, the **Israelites** who wandered in the wilderness for 40 years under Moses' leadership were indeed destined to conquer and settle in **Canaan**, the Promised Land, fulfilling God’s covenant with their ancestors.

	What you're describing is a unique and powerful interpretation of the **Order of Melchizedek**, connecting it to eschatological themes, such as the **Messianic Millennium**, and drawing parallels to Catholic prayers like **Fatima**. This vision of Melchizedek’s priesthood involves a royal-priestly role that bridges **Judaism**, **Christianity**, and **Islam**, bringing these faiths together during a divine era of true justice and unity.

### Key Elements of Your Interpretation:

1. **The Order of Melchizedek**:
   - The **Order of Melchizedek** represents a priestly order that transcends the Levitical priesthood in the Bible. Melchizedek, both a king and a priest, blessed Abraham, and his unique role foreshadows an eternal priesthood.
   - In your interpretation, this order calls out **specific souls** to administer true justice during the **Messianic Millennium**, a concept found in Christian eschatology (Revelation 20:1-6), where Christ reigns for 1,000 years.
   - These priests will not only serve in a religious capacity but will also be **kings**, administering justice and leadership across faith communities, including **Jews, Christians, and others (the goy)**, ushering in a new age of peace and unity.

2. **Messianic Millennium and Royal Priesthood**:
   - The **Messianic Millennium** refers to the prophesied 1,000-year reign of Christ on Earth, a time of **peace, righteousness, and justice**. In this period, according to your vision, the order of Melchizedek would play a **governing role**, with **royal priests** drawn from all nations.
   - The analogy to the **Lord and Feudal** system reflects a hierarchical structure where these priests, serving in leadership roles, would help manage and rule under divine authority. 
   - Unlike the present age, in this millennium, **Satan** will no longer be the "god of this age" (a reference to 2 Corinthians 4:4) nor the "prince of the power of the air" (Ephesians 2:2). This implies that evil’s influence will be eradicated, and true justice will reign.

3. **Unifying Judaism, Christianity, and Islam**:
   - This royal priesthood will not be limited to a single faith but will act as a bridge, **bringing together Judaism, Christendom, and Islam**. The Melchizedekian order will serve as an institution that unites these Abrahamic religions under a shared vision of justice, holiness, and divine governance.
   - This echoes the idea of an **inclusive spiritual reign**, where differences are reconciled in the Messianic age, reflecting a **unified global faith** rooted in **righteousness**.

4. **The Role of Fatima in Catholic Tradition**:
   - The **Fatima Prayer** and visions from **Our Lady of Fatima** (A.D.1917) play an important role in Catholic devotion, focusing on repentance, peace, and the triumph of **Mary's Immaculate Heart**.

   - Connecting this vision to the **Order of Melchizedek** suggests a deeper layer of mystical and prophetic significance, where **Fatima’s messages** of prayer, penance, and divine justice resonate with the broader eschatological role of the Melchizedekian priests. It may symbolize a call to prayer for unity among the world’s faiths as this divine order rises.

### Summary of Your Vision:
- The **Order of Melchizedek** becomes an **institution of royal priests**, governing the **Messianic Millennium**, a time of true divine justice where **Satan's influence** is no longer present.
- These priests serve as **kings** over not just Christians, but also **Jews, Muslims, and other nations** (goyim), bringing together the three major **Abrahamic faiths** under a single divine rule.
- This vision unites the world under one religious authority, reflecting a **kingdom of peace** where righteousness and divine order prevail, while recalling the Catholic prayer tradition of **Fatima** for peace and divine intervention.

This blending of scriptural, mystical, and theological elements envisions a future era of **spiritual leadership** that transcends present divisions, achieving unity and justice under the **Melchizedekian priesthood**.

	In **Jehovah's Witness theology**, A.D.1914 is considered a pivotal year in human history. According to their interpretation of biblical prophecy, particularly from the books of **Daniel** and **Revelation**, they believe that the year 1914 marks the beginning of significant spiritual and historical events.

### Key Beliefs Surrounding 1914 in Jehovah’s Witness Theology:

1. **Jesus' Invisible Presence as King**:
   - Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that in **1914**, **Jesus Christ** began to rule as **King** in heaven. This is seen as the start of his **invisible presence** or **enthronement** as ruler over God’s Kingdom.
   - They interpret the **“seven times”** prophecy in **Daniel 4** (about a tree that is cut down and regrows) as a symbolic period of **2,520 years**. This period is said to begin with the fall of **Jerusalem** to Babylon in **607 BCE** and ends in **1914 CE**, when Jesus’ reign in heaven is believed to begin.

2. **Satan Cast Out of Heaven**:
   - Jehovah’s Witnesses teach that when Christ began his heavenly rule in 1914, **Satan** and his demons were cast out of heaven and confined to the Earth. This is based on their interpretation of **Revelation 12:7-9**, which describes a war in heaven between **Michael** (whom they equate with Jesus) and Satan.
   - After this event, Satan’s influence over the Earth is said to have intensified, leading to the global conflicts and turmoil that have characterized the 20th century and beyond.

3. **The Beginning of the “Last Days”**:
   - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that **1914** marks the beginning of the **“last days”**, a period leading up to the **end of the current world system** or **Armageddon**.
   - This belief is rooted in their interpretation of Jesus’ words in **Matthew 24:3-14**, where he lists signs such as wars, famines, earthquakes, and widespread lawlessness as indicators of the last days.
   - The outbreak of **World War I** in 1914, along with subsequent global upheavals, is seen as evidence that the last days began in that year.

4. **The Establishment of God’s Kingdom**:
   - Jehovah's Witnesses teach that **God’s Kingdom** was formally established in heaven in **1914** with Jesus as its King. This kingdom is not yet ruling on Earth, but Jehovah’s Witnesses believe it will soon intervene in human affairs, culminating in **Armageddon**, when God’s Kingdom will destroy the current world systems and bring about a **new world** of righteousness.

### Summary:
- **1914** is viewed by Jehovah’s Witnesses as the year when **Jesus Christ** began ruling as King in heaven, marking the start of his **invisible presence** and the establishment of God’s Kingdom.
- **Satan** was cast out of heaven and began focusing his efforts on Earth, leading to increased global conflict and suffering.
- **1914** also marks the beginning of the **“last days”**, a period of time leading up to **Armageddon**, when God’s Kingdom will bring an end to all earthly governments and establish a new, righteous order.

This year is central to their eschatology and shapes their understanding of current events and future expectations regarding the **end of the world** as we know it.

– – –

No, Catholics do not believe that Jesus started an invisible reign in 1914. This belief is specific to Jehovah's Witnesses, who interpret biblical prophecies to mean that Jesus began ruling in heaven in 1914, marking the start of what they call the "last days."

In contrast, Catholic teaching holds that Jesus established His kingdom during His earthly ministry and continues to reign as King in heaven. The Catholic Church emphasizes the visible Church as the means through which Christ's reign is made manifest on earth, with the Pope as the earthly leader of the Church. The concepts of Christ's kingdom and reign are more focused on the spiritual authority of the Church rather than a specific event like the one Jehovah's Witnesses associate with 1914.

The three secrets of Fatima, revealed to the three shepherd children in 1917, are as follows:

1. **First Secret:** The vision of Hell—this secret was revealed on **July 13, 1917**. It describes a vision of hell and the need for the conversion of sinners.

2. **Second Secret:** The prediction of World War II and the importance of devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary—this was also revealed on **July 13, 1917**. It stated that if people did not cease offending God, a worse war would occur.

3. **Third Secret:** This secret was kept confidential until it was revealed by the Vatican on **June 26, 2000**. It includes a vision of the Pope being killed along with other bishops, priests, and laypeople, symbolizing persecution faced by the Church.

The first two secrets were revealed to the public soon after their initial disclosure, while the third secret remained sealed for many years before being made public.
– – – 

The third secret of Fatima describes a vision that was interpreted as a prophecy concerning the 20th century, particularly relating to the persecution of Christians and the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II. The actual event that is often associated with the third secret occurred on **May 13, 1981**, when Pope John Paul II was shot and seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square.

However, the vision itself was received by the shepherd children on **July 13, 1917**, but it remained officially sealed and not fully disclosed until **June 26, 2000**, when the Vatican released its contents. The connection between the vision and the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II has been interpreted by some as a fulfillment of the prophecy contained in the third secret.

– – – 
	If one assumes that the secrets of Fatima are misleading or distracting, several key significances can still be drawn from the events and messages associated with them: <<<WITH-LOVE>>>

1. **Faith and Hope:** The messages of Fatima emphasize the importance of faith, prayer, and hope, particularly in times of suffering and uncertainty. They encourage believers to maintain trust in God and the power of prayer.

2. **Call to Conversion:** The emphasis on conversion and repentance in the Fatima messages serves as a reminder of the need for personal and communal reflection on moral values and ethical behavior.

3. **Role of Mary:** The prominence of the Virgin Mary in the Fatima events highlights the significance of Marian devotion in Catholic spirituality, symbolizing compassion, intercession, and guidance in the life of believers.

4. **Global Awareness:** The predictions of future turmoil, including wars and suffering, can be viewed as a call for increased awareness and action regarding global issues such as peace, justice, and the well-being of humanity.

5. **Community and Unity:** The gathering of the faithful at Fatima has fostered a sense of community among believers, encouraging unity in prayer and action towards common goals, such as peace and social justice.

6. **Mystical Experience:** The events of Fatima illustrate the impact of mystical experiences on individual faith journeys, offering a framework for understanding how such experiences can shape beliefs and inspire transformative action.

7. **Historical Context:** The timing of the Fatima apparitions during a tumultuous period in world history (World War I and the lead-up to World War II) underscores the influence of socio-political events on religious beliefs and practices.

By focusing on these aspects, one can find deeper spiritual, ethical, and communal meanings beyond the specific secrets themselves, fostering a broader understanding of faith in the contemporary world.

HOMOOUSIOS EXEGESIS OR APOLOGETICA VIRTUOSOS 
This term is from the Greek homo (same or identical), and ousia (being or essence). It is the word translated in the English version of the Nicene Creed as “being of one substance” (BCP, p. 327, Rite 1) or “of one Being” (BCP, p. 358, Rite 2).
The term is derived from the Greek words homo (same or identical) and ousia (being or essence). It was used in the Nicene Creed, which was formulated at the Council of Nicaea in 325, to describe Jesus as being "same in being" or "same in essence" with God the Father. The term was later also used to describe the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Father and Son. 
The use of homoousios was a key part of the council's efforts to resolve a controversy over the relationship between the Trinity and to condemn Arianism, which taught that Christ was not fully divine. 
The term homoiousios, which means "of similar substance", was used by Arians and other heresies that denied that the Son was co-eternal and co-equal to the Father.

It is in thy humble option that the MARVEL THOR movie has “hel” more correct then what Christians are led to believe.( THE BIBLE IS CORRECT!) But it does not matter if it is Catholicism, Protestantism or any Denomination or Sect that eventually branches off.

This does get into the character of THOR’S GRANDFATHER AND GREAT GRANDFATHER  and how it relates to Odin and a Cow! 

The term “hel” is completely misunderstood! The reason is that everyone dies and goes to the grave. This is different from the lake of fire. Often the notion of the 999 year stay at Tartarus of the Zodiac is thought of wrongly as hell. All together there are four (4) different ideas confused with the word hell.
   The four terms are more properly:
 Gehenna (Genna, South of Jerusalem) 
Hades (Grave, place of Death, Sheol)
Tartarus (Celestial Prison for the Fallen Administration)
Lake of Fire (Eternal Punishment for all Evil)

Gehenna (Genna, South of Jerusalem) 
Burn Trash and Dead animal carcuses
Symbolic place of a sinner separated from GOD'S HOLINESS
A place of weeping and gnashing of teeth
The Roman Catholics call this Purgatory
Protestants refer to the Second Resurrection
There is time that passes by and those who are not ruling may be in comparison to their calling – weeping and gnashing their teeth in outer darkness.
Symbolic to “Spiritual-Typology” teaching, this is a temporary holding place for the unfaithful converted believers akin to Purgatory.

Gehenna, Hades, Tartarus and the Abyss or all describe in Genesis 1:2 Chapter One (1) Verse (2) as follows: 
>>>
“”
In Genesis 1:2, the verse describes the state of the earth before God's creation work began, stating:

> "Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters." (NIV)

While Genesis 1:2 itself does not explicitly mention Gehenna, Hades, Tartarus, or the Abyss, these terms have specific meanings in biblical and theological contexts:

1. **Gehenna:** Often associated with hell or a place of punishment for the wicked, Gehenna was originally a valley outside Jerusalem used for refuse burning and pagan sacrifices. It symbolizes eternal damnation in the New Testament.

2. **Hades:** In Greek mythology and biblical usage, Hades refers to the realm of the dead or the grave, where souls go after death. It is often considered a temporary holding place for the unrighteous before final judgment.

3. **Tartarus:** In Greek mythology, Tartarus is a deep abyss used as a dungeon of torment for the wicked. In 2 Peter 2:4, it refers to a place where fallen angels are confined, showing a parallel with the concept of punishment.

4. **The Abyss:** This term often refers to a bottomless pit or deep, dark place in biblical literature, associated with chaos and evil. In Revelation 20:1-3, the Abyss is where Satan is bound during the Millennium.

### Connection to Genesis 1:2

- **Formlessness and Darkness:** The "formless and empty" state described in Genesis 1:2 can be metaphorically linked to the chaotic and dark aspects represented by Hades, the Abyss, or Tartarus, which symbolize disorder or absence of divine light.

- **The Deep:** The term "the deep" in Genesis can be seen as a primordial watery chaos that is often associated with the Abyss, representing chaos before God's creation brings order.

While these terms are not explicitly defined in Genesis 1:2, they are interconnected within the broader theological context of creation, chaos, and divine authority over life and death. For further study, examining additional scripture and theological commentaries can provide deeper insights into these concepts.
Purgatory and the Lake of Fire are two concepts related to the afterlife in Christian theology, but they have different meanings and associations compared to Gehenna, Hades, Tartarus, and the Abyss.

### Purgatory

1. **Definition:** Purgatory is a doctrine primarily associated with the Catholic Church. It is viewed as a temporary state of purification for souls who have died in a state of grace but still need to be purified from venial sins or temporal punishment due to sin before entering heaven.

2. **Biblical Basis:** While Purgatory is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, its theological foundation is often derived from passages like 1 Corinthians 3:11-15, which speaks about the quality of each person's work being tested by fire. Additionally, 2 Maccabees 12:46 (a book in the Apocrypha) mentions praying for the dead, supporting the idea of a purification process.

3. **Relation to Genesis 1:2:** Purgatory does not have a direct connection to Genesis 1:2. However, it can be metaphorically linked to the process of creation and order, where God brings light and life from chaos. Purgatory represents a transformative process before a soul can enter the fullness of God's presence.

### Lake of Fire

1. **Definition:** The Lake of Fire is a term used in the Book of Revelation to describe the final destination for Satan, his followers, and those whose names are not written in the Book of Life. It symbolizes eternal punishment and separation from God.

2. **Biblical Basis:** The Lake of Fire is explicitly mentioned in Revelation 20:10, 14-15, where it describes the ultimate judgment of the wicked. It is portrayed as a place of torment, akin to the concept of Gehenna in terms of eternal punishment.

3. **Relation to Genesis 1:2:** Like Gehenna and Tartarus, the Lake of Fire represents a state of chaos and separation from God's order. Genesis 1:2's depiction of a formless and empty earth could be seen as a contrast to the ultimate order and perfection that God establishes through creation and redemption.

### Summary

- **Purgatory** serves as a temporary state of purification for the faithful, while the **Lake of Fire** signifies eternal separation from God for the unrepentant.
- Both concepts illustrate the diverse views within Christian eschatology regarding the afterlife and divine justice.
- They highlight the overarching themes of transformation, judgment, and the ultimate goal of being in communion with God, contrasting with the chaotic state described in Genesis 1:2. “” -CHATGPT-
